An experiment usually tests a hypothesis, which is an expectation about how a particular process or phenomenon
works. However, an experiment may also aim to answer a what if question, without a specific expectation about what the
experiment reveals, or to confirm prior results. If an experiment is carefully conducted, the results usually either 
support or disprove the hypothesis. According to some philosophies of science, an experiment can never prove a
hypothesis, it can only add support. On the other hand, an experiment that provides a counterexample can disprove a theory
or hypothesis. An experiment must also control the possible confounding factors any factors that would mar the accuracy 
or repeatability of the experiment or the ability to interpret the results. Confounding is commonly eliminated through 
scientific controls and or, in randomized experiments, through random assignment.
