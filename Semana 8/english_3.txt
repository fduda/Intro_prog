In the engineering design process, engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find novel solutions 
to problems or to improve existing solutions. More than ever, engineers are now required to have a proficient knowledge 
of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, many engineers continue to learn new material throughout 
their career. If multiple solutions exist, engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best
matches the requirements. The crucial and unique task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the 
constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result. It is generally insufficient to build a technically 
successful product, rather, it must also meet further requirements.
