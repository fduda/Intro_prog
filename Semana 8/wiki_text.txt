Because of their simplicity, text files are commonly used for storage of information.  They
avoid some of the problems encountered with other file formats, such as endianness, padding bytes, or differences
in the number of bytes in a machine word. Further, when data corruption occurs in a text file, it is often easier to
recover and continue processing the remaining contents. A disadvantage of text files is that they usually have a low 
entropy, meaning that the information occupies more storage than is strictly necessary. A simple text
file needs no additional metadata to assist the reader in interpretation, and therefore may contain no data at all, which is a case of zero byte file.
