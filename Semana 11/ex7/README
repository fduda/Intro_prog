Main functions:

1. draw: This method receives coordinates from a polygon and draws it using the Turtle class.
2. perimeter: This method receives coordinates from a polygon and returns its perimeter
3. is_convex: This method receives coordinates from a polygon. Returns True if the polygon is convex and false if it is not.
4. translate: This method receives coordinates from a polygon and translates it.
5. rotate: This method receives coordinates from a polygon and rotates it.
6. __eq__: This method checks if two polygons are identical.
7. is_congruent: This method checks whether two polygons are congruent.
8. area: This method receives coordinates from a polygon and returns its area.
9. intersect: This method receives coordinates from a polygon and checks whether two edges of the polygon intersect into a vertex.
10. is_valit: This method receives coordinates from a polygon and checks whether it's valid.
11. centroid: This method receives coordinates from a polygon and returns its centroid.

Auxiliary functions:

1. list_of_points_cartesian: This method receives coordinates from a polygon in the  form [x_0, x_1, ..., x_n],[y_0, y_1, ..., y_n] 
and returns  a list of coordinates in the form [x_0,y_0], [x_1, y_1]...[x_n, y_n].
2. list_of_points_polar: This method receives coordinates in carthesian form and converts it to polar form.
3. convert_points_to_list: This method receives coordinates from a polygon in the form [x_0,y_0], [x_1, y_1]...[x_n, y_n] 
and returns a list of coordinates in the form [x_0, x_1, ..., x_n],[y_0, y_1, ..., y_n]
4. distance_between_points: This method receives two points and calculate the distance between them.
5. polar_angle: This function receives a point and returns its polar angle.
6. convert_cartesian_to_polar: This method converts a point from cartesian form to polar form.
7: convert_polar_to_cartesian: This method converts a point from polar form to cartesian form.
8. divide_into_triangles: This method divides a polygon into triangles.
9. is_triangle: This method checks if the polygon is a triangle.
10: eq_line: This method receives two points and returns the line that connects them.
11. lines_intersection: This method receives two lines and returns their intersection.
12: is_point_in_line: This method receives a point and a line and checks if the point is in the line.
