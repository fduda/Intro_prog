I discussed the exercise with no one.
I read and searched about the turtle library and the math library in the following links:

https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html
https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html

==================
1. hello_turtle: A script that draws a sky with stars by drawing clusters of stars. Each cluster draws 3 stars.
2. print_math: We define some mathematical functions that return us numerical results.

One big difference is the print function. In Python 3 it demands parentheses, so we write print("Hello World"), in
Python 2, the parentheses are optional: print "Hello World". Another difference is the integer division: in Python 3 its
done through the use of "//", while in Python 2 it's done by the use of "/".
