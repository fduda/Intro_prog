I discussed the exercise with no one.
I read and searched about the format string method in the following link

I read and searched about lists in the following link

=  Description:  =
==================
1. compute_mean: this function computes the mean by receiving three parameters: two numbers and the mean type.
2. natural_language_compute_mean: this function reveives a string as a parameter. The string is a phrase the user writes containing the numbers and the mean type.
3. user_input_computer_mean: this function does not receive parameters. It asks the user to input two numbers and then asks him to input what type of mean he wants to calculate. Then, calculates the mean and prints it.
4. is_first_player_winner: this function is a game. I receives 4 parameters, the first two are the first player numbers, and the last two are the second players numbers.
Then, the function calculates all the three means for each player, and subtracts the results of the same mean. Then, adds all the results. If the result of the sum is positive or 0, the function returns True, else, it returns False.
5. fancy_arithmetic_mean: this function does not receive parameters. It asks the user to input a number between 1 and 5, this number being the number of numbers he would like to calculate the arithmetic mean. 
If the number is bigger then 5 or smaller than 1, prints a message. Else, it asks the user to input what numbers he would like to use to calculate the mean, one in each line. Then, calculates the mean and prints the result.
