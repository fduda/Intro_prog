I discussed the exercise with no one.
I read and searched about the format string method in the following link

One big difference is the print function. In Python 3 it demands parentheses, so we write print("Hello World"), in
Python 2, the parentheses are optional: print "Hello World". Another difference is the integer division: in Python 3 its
done through the use of "//", while in Python 2 it's done by the use of "/".
