I discussed the exercise with no one.

I read and searched about the reversed() method for lists in te following link
https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/list/reverse

I used an example given by Matan in his class as a base to write the function max_sequence().

==================
1. fancy_mean: a function that receives a series of inputs from the user and 
returns the three types of mean: arithmetic, geometric and harmonic. Some 
other functions were added to calculate the three types of mean.

2. is_palindrome: a function that checks if a list is a palindrome. That is, 
if it can be read backwards and still the same list.

3. lucky_tosses: a function that receives a list of coin tosses represented 
by 0 and 1. Then it calculates the percentage of each type of result in 
relation to the total. Calculates the longest streak of the same result and 
how many streaks longer than 5. Some other functions were added to calculate
the longest streak and how many streaks are longer than 5 elements.

4. cumulative_distribution: a function that receives two lists. For each 
value in the second list it returns the ratio of numbers on the first list 
that are smaller or equal the first number. Then, returns a new list with 
all the ratios.

5. equal_product_pairs: a function that receives an integer and returns all 
the pairs of integers that results in n when multiplied.

6. pascal_triangle: a function that receives an integer n and prints the first 
n lines of the Pascal's Triangle.
