I discussed the exercise with no one.

I read and searched about sets and its methods on the following link:

=  Description:  =
==================
1) cards_intersect: This functions receives two cards (lists) and checks if they have a symbol (string) in common.

2) remove_card: This function receives a deck (list of lists) and a card (list of strings). If the card is in the deck, the 
function removes it and returns the boolean True, if not, it prints an error message and returns the boolean False.

3) add_card: This function receives a deck (list of lists) and a card (list of words). If the new card has the same 
lenght of the cards in the deck, and if it has exactly one common symbol with the other cards in the deck, adds the new card 
to the deck and returns the boolean True. If not, prints an error message and returns the boolean False.

4) is_valid: This function checks if the deck is valid. It uses three other functions (check_string, check_card_size and check_intersections)
 to better organize the code.

5) check_string: This function receives a deck (list of lists). It checks if every list inside the outter is made exclusively by strings.

6) check_card_size: This function receives a a deck (list of lists). It checks if every card (list inside deck) inside it has the same lenght.

7) check_intersections: This function receives a deck (list of lists). It checks if every pair of cards (list) has exactly one symbol in common.

8) draw_random_cards: This function receies a deck (list of lists) and returns two random cards (lists) from the deck.

9) print_symbols_counts: This function receives a deck (list of lists) and returns the number of symbols in the deck's cards.

10) play_dobble: This function receives a deck (list of lists) and plays the game Dobble. This function uses the other functions created previously.

11) time_average: This function receives a list of times taken to guess the correct answer from the previous function and returns the average, 
rounded to two decimal digits.

12) add_remove_count: This function execute three different functions (add_card, remove_card, print_symbols_counts) based on the users input on run_dobble function.
